# K-Way Merge

# Introduction

This pattern helps us solve problems that involve a list of sorted arrays.

Whenever we are given ‘K’ sorted arrays, we can use a **Heap** to efficiently perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays. We can push the smallest (first) element of each sorted array in a **Min Heap** to get the overall minimum. While inserting elements to the **Min Heap** we keep track of which array the element came from. We can, then, remove the top element from the heap to get the smallest element and push the next element from the same array, to which this smallest element belonged, to the heap. We can repeat this process to make a sorted traversal of all elements.

## When to use

Whenever you’re given **‘K’ sorted arrays**, you can use a Heap to efficiently **perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays**. You can push the smallest element of each array in a Min Heap to **get the overall minimum**. After getting the overall minimum, push the next element from the same array to the heap. Then, repeat this process to make a sorted traversal of all elements.

# Merge K Sorted Lists

## Problem

```python
"""
Merge K Sorted Lists:

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:
    Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
    Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
    Explanation: The linked-lists are:
    [
    1->4->5,
    1->3->4,
    2->6
    ]
    merging them into one sorted list:
    1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:
    Input: lists = []
    Output: []
Example 3:
    Input: lists = [[]]
    Output: []
Example 4:
    Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8]
Example 5:
    Input: L1=[5, 8, 9], L2=[1, 7]
    Output: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9]

## Solution

```python
from typing import List
import heapq

"""
Solution:

[[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]

# Non-optimal Solution:
    using pointers ->
    Time complexity : O(kN) where k is the number of linked lists.
    Almost every selection of node in final linked costs O(k) time. There are N nodes in the final linked list.
There are NN nodes in the final linked list.
- for each list, create a pointer to the head of the list
- compare the values of the pointers, and add the smaller value to the result list

# Optimal Solution:
    using heap ->
    Time complexity : O(klogk) where k is the number of linked lists.
- add the first element of each list to a heap (keep track of the list((index or node) and the value))
- while the heap is not empty:
    - pop the smallest element from the heap and add it to the result list
    - add the next element of the list to the heap
- return the result list
