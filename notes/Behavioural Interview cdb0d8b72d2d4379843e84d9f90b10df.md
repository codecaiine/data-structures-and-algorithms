So, what exactly is a behavioural interview? It's an interview dominated by questions that will get to the root of how you've **performed and behaved in the past** with **actual results and scenarios**. Behavioural questions are asked to assess if a person is a right fit for the job, team and company, and are designed to see if a job candidate’s past behaviour will predict his or her future performance.

If technical interviews gauge your programming skills, behavioural interviews attempt to discover how you act in employment-related  ..7 m m.f vbd,mw5situations or conflicts, both positive and negative.

### Any good resource for a behavioural interview?

have a clear point you want to convey b4 starting to talk

Every company has some sort of “leadership principles” that your questions should be based around.

- Amazon has by far the most with 14. So I suggest using theirs for full coverage and just making an excel table with 2 stories for all 14 principles and then filling it in with different stories you have that show growth or potential for each principle.
- 28 is a fuck-ton of stories and you definitely don’t have enough to completely fill it out at this point in your career, but you should try to limit how many times you reuse a story.
- That being said, it doesn’t really hurt much to reuse a story for a different principle because if you play it right, it can show that you are atleast a little self aware. Just don’t use the same story for the same principle even if it’s with a different interviewer at the company.
- Ultimately, the goal is to show the interviewer that you prepared. So once you have your table filled out, practice picking them at random and using the STAR method to explain them to the anime body pillow we all know you have in the corner of your room

- dominance through confidence
    - if you don't know the answer just be confident
    - take command during unclear situations

Have a clear statement of your objective; in particular, make sure that you tailor your r6sum6

for a given employer. For example: My outstanding ability is developing solutions to compu-
tationally challenging problems; communicating them in written and oral form; and working
with teams to implement them. I would like to apply these abilities atXYZ."

(2.) The most important points-the ones that differentiate you from everyone else-should come
first. People reading your r6sum6 proceed in sequential order, so you want to impress them
with what makes you special early on. (Maintaining a logical flow, though desirable, is sec-
ondary compared to this principle.) As a consequence, you should not list your programming
languages, coursework, etc. early on, since these are likely common to everyone. You should
list significant class projects (this also helps with keywords for HR.), as well as talks/papers
you've presented, and even standardized test scores, if truly exceptional.

## **What the interviewer is looking for:**

An interviewer may be wondering:

- Is this person calm under pressure?
- Can I rely on this person in a team?
- Will this person treat their peers with respect?
- Are you comfortable giving formal presentations?
- Can you respectfully give your boss bad news?

**Motivation**

When I ask this question, I’m less concerned with the candidate’s answer and more focused on their thought process. The HOWs and WHYs are the keys for me. Anecdotally, when I’ve asked this question, the majority of the candidates prioritize in the following order: V.P., manager, then the customer. Candidates rarely dig deeper to find out what the requests are. Instead, they prioritize based on titles alone.

I’m mainly looking for two things in the candidate’s response. **Thought process** and **effective communication**.

**Thought Process**

Does the candidate ask for more information to make an informed decision on how to prioritize? What if the issue the V.P. is facing is the inability to connect their bluetooth speaker to their laptop so they can listen to music in their office? Is that truly more important than a customer needing help? After hearing the needs, are they able to correctly prioritize based on the information they’ve received?

**Communication**

Do they show that they are they able to communicate with people at different levels? Moreover, are they able to deliver “bad” news to people at different levels? Will they let everyone know how and when they plan to address their needs? This is my favourite question because you can go in a number of different ways depending on how the interview is going. The other added benefit is that it works with candidates at almost every level.

### **What interviewers are really assessing**

So, what are interviewers really assessing during behavioural interviews? Depending on the job, it may be your ability to **work in teams** and **collaborate** with others. The culture may value knowledge sharing or being a good motivator. They might prioritise self-awareness, growth mindset, ambition, humility, comfort with ambiguity, or risk tolerance.

Whether you will be pioneering a new role or backfilling an existing one, the interviewer knows more about the job than you do. They also know more about the existing team and organisation. Therefore, they may be listening for certain capabilities and behaviours that will be more likely to make a new hire successful.

In other words, the interviewer is trying to learn about all the parts of you that are usually hidden from employers until they are revealed as a problem or a virtue. Behavioral interviews ensure that employers have as much information as possible when making hiring decisions.

## **Why Do Behavioral Interviews Matter?**

Acing the technical interview is obviously important, but the behavioural interview is just as critical if you want to stand out as a desirable candidate. Technical skills are replaceable, after all. What really makes you hireable must go beyond those skills to something else. This insight into your behaviour and capacity for self-reflection may be the thing that makes or breaks you in the job hunt.

A hiring team wants to bring someone on board who will **make their lives easier** and who will fit in with the company. Behavioural interviews are a vital determining factor. They are even used for reducing legal risks, implementing policies of equality, and building fulfilling work environments. It’s a common misconception in the tech world that soft skills are less important than technical skills. The reality is quite the opposite: soft skills are often the determining factor for hiring a candidate.

Check out what [experts at Amazon](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/how-amazon-hires) are saying about soft skills assessment. Soft skills will make or break you as a potential hire.

They demonstrate longevity, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work in a team. In fact, soft skills are one of the only ways to stand out to non-developers on the hiring committee, who may not be familiar with the technical skills you bring to the table.

Behavioural interviews matter just as much as your coding interviews, so it’s time to prepare!

## **What if you're an entry-level candidate with little to no work experience?**

If you're a candidate fresh out of school with little relevant work experience, your interviewer should already realize this. You'll be asked similar behavioral interview questions as an experienced hire would be asked, and all of the above points on how to prepare still apply to you. Your answers, however, will be based on results or how you handled situations in college, within organizations, on sports teams, at a part-time job, within your family and so on.

## Cultural Interviews

The cultural interview is often a candidate’s first impression within a organisation, so don’t take these interviews lightly. Although, typically, cultural interviews aren’t as terrifying as coding interviews, interviewers can make or break your application. Most likely this interview will be run by a recruiter. They may, or may not, have development experience, but they should be able to have an intelligent conversation about front-end technologies.

It’s important to truly impress your recruiter because their opinion could have a massive impact on your application. If you make it to the second or third round of interviews, and the organisation is ***“on-the-fence”*** about pushing you through, the recruiter might be your biggest advocate. So be sure to impress.

Typically, cultural interviews start with “**So tell me about yourself**.” It’s imperative to have a well-thought out response to this question. Let’s examine two responses:

![Behavioural%20Interview%20cdb0d8b72d2d4379843e84d9f90b10df/5797335465459712.svg](Behavioural%20Interview%20cdb0d8b72d2d4379843e84d9f90b10df/5797335465459712.svg)

You can see that Max was clearly unprepared for this question and **doesn’t seem like the type of person who, when put on the spot, can eloquently handle the situation**. With Paige, however, she is much more well-spoken. Not only was she able to **succinctly sum up her experience**, but her responses **elicited emotion and *pride*** in regards to her **previous roles**. Plus, throwing in a line or two about her hobbies gives insight into the type of person she is.

### General Tips

- Study the **job description**.
- Review **major projects** you’ve worked on.
- Make a list of your **professional accomplishments**.
- Use the [STAR method]() to structure your response. ([discussed below]())
- **Practice** your interview responses aloud.
- Keep your answers **under two minutes**.

With these kinds of questions, interviewers are usually trying to learn three things: 

- First, they want to know how you **behaved in a real-world situation**.
- Second, they want to understand the **measurable value you added** to that situation.
- Finally, they are trying to learn **how you define something** like “pressure at work”—a concept different people might interpret differently.

Success in a behavioural interview is all about preparation. There aren’t necessarily wrong answers.

## Use the STAR method to structure answers to behavioural questions

### ****Situation / Context****

What is the **context** of your story? Ask yourself, what was the ***problem***? Be as **specific as possible**. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances. In setting the situation, you are telling your listener **when or where** this event took place. For example, “*We were working on a six-month contract for a high-value client when our agency merged with another, larger firm…*”

### ****Task****

Then, determine what the ***goal*** was - ask, what did you need to do and why? What was ***your role*** / responsibility in this situation? For example, *“It was my role to lead the transition for my group while also communicating with our client to keep the project on track.”*

### ****Action / Steps Taken****

What did **you do**? Identify the specific ***steps you took to reach the goal***. For example, *“I set up weekly check-ins with the client to update them on the progress of the merger. This cemented an important level of trust between us. I also had regular one-on-ones with each person on the team, both to assess how they were handling the change and to make sure we would meet our deadlines.”*

### ****Result / Outcome / Takeaway / Measurable Value****

What did your actions lead to? What **measurable value** did you add? Report the ***final outcome***. This is the time to talk yourself up. Take credit for what you accomplished, and if you can highlight multiple positives, even better! 
For example, *“We ended up completing the project on time, meeting all of their specifications. It was incredibly rewarding to navigate a lot of change and succeed under pressure.”*

### **Using the STAR Method, here's how you would formulate a response:**

S: Our team revenues were down in the last quarter of the year.

T: We had to increase our revenue by 10 percent.

A: I overhauled our outdated and ineffective processes, and worked with my teammates to develop a new, more effective approaches.

R: Thanks to processes I overhauled and the new approaches I instituted, we increased our revenue by 12 percent that quarter.

**Sample STAR Response**

Sample Star Response: “Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?”

- **S:** There was a team member in a project I was managing whose pace was lagging behind the others.
- **T:** We were in the hyper-growth phase of a company project, so each member had to do research and produce a certain amount of content per week. The goal was to create 50 internet articles per month in order to bring more traffic to the platform.
- **A:** We got together to address the issue. I explained that although he was falling behind, he could still improve by making a few adjustments to his strategy. I also encouraged him to collaborate with other members if he was struggling with something.
- **R:** His productivity increased and he felt more confident in his work which led to the team meeting the monthly quota, and to him producing some great ideas.

**Remember:** If you answer and the interviewer asks about another detail, please don’t panic. That is a *good sign*. You want the interviewer to clarify, it means that they’re listening and the example was relevant.

Because behavioural interview questions can be complex, **write out your answers**. This will help you think it through more fully. Then practice with someone whose professional opinion you trust.
Read the job description carefully. Make a list of the **top skills** or **qualifications** it calls for. Think of a story that **demonstrates your ability** in each area. Following the STAR technique, write your stories down, including the situation, task, action and result. Then, practice saying them out loud several times, either by yourself or with a friend. Keep in mind that your answer should only take about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. As you include each of the elements, try to be succinct.

## **On sounding ‘rehearsed’**

If you are worried that practicing might leave you sounding rehearsed, that’s ok. Chances are that what sounds “rehearsed” to you is actually just the sound of you ***completely owning the interview***.

However, you can always say something like, “**I just heard my own response, and it sounds a bit rehearsed. I really prepared for this interview because it is important to me.** You can count on my answers being genuine, even if they are practiced." This way, you will be able to put your mind at ease while also proving to the interviewer that you are very serious about the role.

It’s authentic for you to present your best self and [show enthusiasm for the company](https://www.notion.so/Keywords-Recruiter-Call-Cover-Letter-e071c4dfba0d44fc87f724e5f6c499ff). Maybe you aren’t sure that you are interested in the role and are just interviewing to get the practice. Even then, you can still be authentic in wanting to do well and open to discovering your true interests. No matter what, always make room for gratitude and an appreciation for the opportunity to be considered. You never know, you might fall in love with the job along the way.

Pro Tip: Make sure that everything you say in a response is relevant to the response. Everything that you mention should come back around, if it doesn’t, then it should not be included. For example, think of a recipe in a cookbook. The “ingredient” section only lists things that will be used to make the dish - nothing more, nothing less. Do the same for your answers.

# Borrowing from law

## Answering law questions

### **Answer the question that was asked**

The person interviewing you **has a job to do**. It is their responsibility to assess your fit for the organization in the time allowed. They may have **specific questions** they need to ask or **specific characteristics** to assess. **They have an agenda** and it’s best to let them lead.

If a candidate takes too much time answering, elaborates in ways that aren’t helpful, or gives a response that isn’t related to the question, it interferes with the interviewer’s plan. The interviewer may become concerned about **managing time** or **annoyed** that they aren’t getting the input they need.

Be **concise first** and **elaborate later** if asked to say more. Witnesses are told to be sure they understand the question being asked, and then give the **shortest truthful answer they can give**. They are trained to listen all the way to the end of the question before beginning a response. Doing this will help you avoid jumping in with an answer to the question you thought they were asking, and being wrong.

**Answer the question that was asked and only the question that was asked.** The interviewer may have a **logical series of questions** planned. A response that moves in a tangent can interfere with assessing what really matters. Don’t keep talking because you have other things that you think will make you sound good. Answer the question that was asked.

The testimony of a witness should be factual, without exaggeration or hyperbole. This applies to candidates too! Using simple language and avoiding jargon will serve you and your listener best. “Blowing them away” with acronyms and technical lingo can backfire. The interviewer wants you to demonstrate that you can talk to any team member in the organisation, not just those with specialised expertise.

### **Get confirmation**

If you are unsure of the question, ask for it to be repeated. You might also say:

- I’m not following the question, can you ask it in another way?
- Can you tell me a bit more about what you want?
- Do you mean……?

You can also begin your response and **ask for confirmation that your response is what they had in mind**.

- I can give you an example of a time I missed a deadline, is that what you’re asking?
- I can tell you about my experience leading a remote team, is that a good example?

The interviewer will likely give you more guidance if you are missing the mark.

Don’t talk over someone in the interview. If an interviewer or panelist starts talking during your response, stop talking for a moment. They are likely trying to give guidance or manage expectations. Before you resume, ask, “shall I continue?”

### **Avoid talking in absolutes**

Witnesses are advised to avoid saying things like “never” or “always”. Such phrases are too precise and can trigger skepticism. Instead, express your preferences, intentions, and actions in a **natural way** that gives you some room for things out of your control. Here are some ideas:

- I’m always on time → I prefer being on time whenever possible.
- I’m never insensitive → I work hard to give feedback in a constructive way that considers personal feelings.
- That’s everything that happened → Those are the examples I can recall right now.

### **Control the pace**

Witnesses are encouraged to **take their time** if they feel like the questions are coming too fast. They are told they can **slow the pace** by taking a sip of water, adjusting their glasses, shifting their posture, taking a deep breath, or asking for the question to be repeated. In an interview, you can use these techniques to set a consistent pace for questions and responses. You don’t have to wait until you need a moment. You can take a moment each time. This shows confidence and sets a relaxed and natural conversational pace.

### **Why we use video**

Video is used for witness preparation and many other types of professional speaking development. Video is the fastest cure for distracting tics. Most people have them, but few are aware of them. For example, you might fidget, bite your nails, play with a ring on your finger, or repeatedly touch your face. You might string together thoughts with phrases like, “you know”, “ok”, or “like”. These are unconscious and a reaction to the **stress of being scrutinised**. You are probably unaware of these or assume that they will go away when you answer “for real” in an interview.

# Examples

## **Familiarize Yourself With Types of Questions**

**Prior experience questions**

Prior experience questions gauge your ***past behaviour*** as predictors of future behaviour. Interviewers want to get a pulse on your instincts, tendencies, and influences. A prior work experience question will almost always ask you to reflect on your past. You can recognise these questions by listening for cues such as past tense verbs and story-based responses.

Common prior experience questions are:

- Give me a specific example of a time **when you failed at something**.
- Tell me about a time when you **experienced blockers at work**.
- Tell me about a **difficult problem** you had to solve at work.
- Tell me about a time when you **asked for help**.

Your answers should focus primarily on your ***actions, accomplishments, and thought processes.*** 

Avoid describing decisions made as a team or answers that **did not directly require your effort**. This means you should use the “I” pronoun as much as you can.

Look at the difference between these two responses.

- I learned that it’s important to take responsibility for my actions.
- We learned that it’s important for everyone to take responsibility in the team.

Focusing on yourself seems confident and well-informed. The interviewer cannot gauge your behavior as well if you speak in terms of others.

Curate your answers to the [company’s values and core principles](https://www.notion.so/Keywords-Recruiter-Call-Cover-Letter-e071c4dfba0d44fc87f724e5f6c499ff). 

**Hypotheticals**

Hypothetical questions deal with the “what if”. They gauge your ability to apply past experiences to potential challenges as well as your instincts when faced with company-specific issues. An interviewer will listen for your ***creativity and personal biases***. You can recognise these questions by listening for cues like these:

- “If…”
- “Imagine…”
- “You’re asked to…”
- “Put yourself in the position of…”
- “If you could have…”
- “It’s 2050 and…”
- “You’re in charge of x,y,z and…”

Pro Tip: If you are someone who loves details and accuracy, you will be tempted to ask for specifics before answering. Resist this urge! This is a hypothetical situation, not a real one. If you need specifics, state them as your assumptions. For example, “I will assume that the team is co-located,” or “I will say it’s springtime and temperatures outside are moderate.”

The key to answering these questions is to **avoid too much detail**. **Any specifics in your answer should be framed as assumptions**.

This is also where your company-specific research comes in handy. If you know upfront what an organization values, you can tailor your hypothetical responses to match their needs.

It’s also good to use these questions for thinking aloud, so long as your responses are thoughtful and rational. There is a difference between rambling and actively processing information. Let the interviewer see how your brain works when posed with different challenges.

**Values-based questions**

Values-based questions offer the opportunity to assess **if you are a good match for the organisation and role**. This includes the personal values that you bring to the table. Interviewers don’t just want to hire talented individuals; they also want to build effective teams that fit with their goals. This is where your research on company values and the position comes in handy, which we will discuss later. Many of these questions might be phrased as hypotheticals, or they may ask you to describe your ideal work environment. Listen for cues such as:

- **Describe your ideal…**
- What would you like to see…
- How do you implement (insert value) in your practice?
- What matters to you…

Leadership also plays an important role in values-based questions. Interviewers want to hire potential leaders who fit with their culture and vibe. For example, a hierarchical organization will be less attracted to a candidate who loves democratic decision-making.

Take note that these questions are also an opportunity for you to assess your interest in the role. You are also interviewing the company! As they pose questions about your values, you can reflect on how fulfilled you would be in that culture and role.

**Teamwork**

For questions like these, you want a story that illustrates your ability to work with others under challenging circumstances. Think team conflict, difficult project constraints, or clashing personalities.

1. Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.
2. Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?
3. Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?
4. We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.
5. Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

**Ability to Adapt**

Times of turmoil are finally good for something! Think of a recent work crisis you successfully navigated. Even if your navigation didn’t feel successful at the time, find a lesson or silver lining you took from the situation.

1. Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
2. Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
3. Tell me about the first job you’ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?
4. Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.
5. Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?

**Client-facing Skills**

If the role you’re interviewing for works with clients, definitely be ready for one of these. Find an example of a time where you successfully represented your company or team and delivered exceptional customer service.

1. Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
2. Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
3. Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.
4. Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
5. When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

## **Behavioural interview questions**

### Tell me about a time when you experienced failure.

**Response**

“I was leading the implementation of new shipping and inventory management systems for 35 manufacturing plants. During our pilot plant implementation, we had major hardware failures with the scanning solution installed on forklifts. The failures were so bad that we had to resrto to manual processes to keep the business going. This required us to double our staffing during the pilot. I delayed further rollouts by 8 weeks to solve the hardware problems, increasing costs. The failures during the pilot created concerns with our stakeholders that we had to overcome.”

**Take a look at this answer again. Did you notice how many times “we” was used versus “I”? Now, let’s take a look at another version of the same response.**

**Alternate response**

" **I learned how important it is to take responsibility for a failure** as the leader of a team. By taking responsibility, **acknowledging the problems, and committing to solutions**, I **was able to** keep the support of the plant leadership. I also remembered that a few of the team members had asked me before the launch about doing more hardware testing and I had dismissed their concerns. **I apologized** to them and promised to do better going forward. My personal **takeaway** was to be a better listener and give full consideration to concerns that are brought to my attention."

**How does this version of the answer read in comparison? Sounds more autonomous, right?** 

### When things go wrong, how do you deal with it? Give me an example of a situation you dealt with in a previous role.

Response:

"I was working as an App Developer for XYZ Company when a Zero-Day Privilege Elevation vulnerability was discovered. Microsoft issued a patch and we had 6000 Windows servers running in 4 different data centres that all needed to be patched as quickly and efficiently as possible (Situation). 
It wasn’t my job to patch servers, but the VP asked all of us for ideas to get the work done faster (Tasks).
I suggested that several of us could help do validation if the procedure was documented. Others could help with tracking the servers coming in and out of rotation and updating tickets. This freed up the Systems Engineers to do the work that only they could do (Actions). 
I had never done some of those tasks before, so I had to follow procedures exactly and ask for help if I wasn’t sure about something. I was willing to take directions and learn. I took good notes and helped make the documentation easier to follow (Results). I gained a new appreciation for the Systems and Security Engineers. We worked long hours, but it felt good to pull together. It was also good to know that we could do that again if a serious security issue came up. "

"I"  >  " We"

### If I were your supervisor and asked you to do something that you disagreed with, what would you do?

**Response**

"If my supervisor asked me to do something I disagreed with I would respectfully push back. I would **ask questions about the value of the project/feature/task (etc.) and how it would benefit the greater good of users**. It’s **important to me that I believe in what I’m working on** and if I disagree with it, I think that it’s important and appropriate to push back against my management for further explanation.” 

Pro Tip: You can take advantage of hypothetical questions to highlight specific skills that you know will be beneficial to the organisation (hence why it is important to do your homework!).

In the example below, you will see two different responses to the same question that highlight different talents.

### How would you design a field test for wearable devices used to track dinosaurs in Jurassic Park?

**Response 1**

" What a fun question! I would do an exhaustive pre-test to maximise the testing that can be done in a safe way. I would assemble a team that includes the animal caretakers and experts, someone from park operations and a device testing expert. I would get as much input as possible from the team I curated. I would plan to test the devices on humans first, then take the trial to the zoo to test on animals that are non-threatening. With a series of graduated testing, we could validate our processes for data collection, support, provisioning, and problem management. Lower level testing could verify device operations within humidity and temperature ranges. "

This response highlights the candidate’s ability to plan and solicit advice from experts.

Pro Tip: It’s OK to think out loud when you are answering hypothetical questions. In fact, it’s better so that the interviewer can see the way your brain works.

**Response 2** 

" I love this question, Jurassic Park is my favourite movie! I would gather all my friends with pets. We would plan a series of three weekly pet playdates at the city park for 2 hours each. The testing team would arrive at the park early to set up all their equipment and outfit the pets. With each weekly iteration, we would deal with problems or miscalculations that we found. Then, I would talk to my father who works at a construction company that is currently building a high-rise downtown. I would ask if we could put devices on the construction workers and some of the equipment for three straight days. The devices should be exposed to the elements as much as possible. After completing the four tests, I would gather, compare, and analyse the test results with the team. "

This response highlights the candidate’s **creativity** and ability to **succeed with limited resources**. These talents would be great to highlight if you are interviewing at a small company or start-up.

### Give me an example of an org culture where you felt like you could do your best work. What was it about the culture that allowed you to perform well?

Response

" When I was at ABC Foundation, there was a real focus on **sharing information**. We worked in teams of 8-10 people, each with a Lead. Leads reported up to managers that had two or three teams. The culture was very **collaborative**. Everybody worked on everything, so you got to know each other’s code and areas of expertise. If you discovered a new problem or way to do something, you were expected to add it to the KB. There was less reliance on tribal knowledge than there is at other places I’ve worked. There was no pressure to act like you know everything. If you had a question, you owned the question until it was answered, and then you were responsible for documenting the answer so others would have it. It wasn’t ok to just pose a question and be stuck if nobody responded. I got better at writing code other people could follow. My documentation really improved. We debated things and tested new ideas, but it wasn’t about something being right or winning an argument. It was about finding the best way to do something, which is really satisfying to me. If I were to join your company, I would hope to foster the same behaviours. "

### **More Examples:**

### **1. Tell me about a time you had a conflict with someone within the organization.**

As you know, conflict is a part of life, and it’s extremely common within companies given people spend most of their days working side-by-side with different people and personalities. So, hiring managers ask this question to gauge ***how you resolve differences with other people -*** and figure out how you'd do it at their company too.

### **2. Tell me about a time you worked on a challenging team project.**

Chances are you are going to have to work as part of a team and companies want to know that you **play nice when you are collaborating**, which is why they will often ask this question. Companies want to learn if you are **able to collaborate with others**, **can *handle any problems*** that may arise and if you are generally a ***team player***.

### **3. Do you prefer to work alone or with others?**

Regardless of the type of business, interviewers ask this question as a way to see if the job candidate will fit into the company culture. They know their environment - and will use this question to see if you'd fit in or have big problems acclimating.

### **4. Tell me about a time you took a leadership role. What was the role and what was the outcome?**

Suited more for senior-level job candidates, this is a behavioural question that many companies ask to see if you have ***leadership potential***. Not only is it very hard to fake this question, but it’s a great one to use to see if you possess any leadership abilities.

### **5. What’s the most difficult problem you had to solve? How did you navigate it?**

Problem-solving is an important skill in almost every job, which is why companies will ask job candidates to tell them about a difficult problem they had to solve. Here, a hiring manager wants to learn if you are the type to run to your manager any time there is a situation - ***or someone who will deal with the situation on your own***.

### **6. If a coworker had an annoying habit, and it hindered your quality of work, how would you resolve it?**

This may seem like a perplexing question, but it’s “designed to get to you how you deal with others,” explains Crawford. “Draw from a real-life experience if possible. What annoyed you? How did you resolve it? Is there a more effective way to handle the situation if it would happen again? Identify the annoying habit and then outline the steps you would take to try and resolve the situation while maintaining a good relationship with your coworker.”

### **7. Tell me about the worst manager you ever had. How did you navigate him or her?**

Before you bash your last boss, “remember that your hiring manager has your resume and knows where you have worked, so your managers won’t be completely anonymous,” warns Crawford. “However, you might explain a type of management style that wasn’t ideal for you. And if you haven’t had a bad manager, don’t make one up. Let the hiring manager know that you honestly have gotten along with your previous managers, and focus on how you are able to work with different personality and management styles.”

### **8. Tell me about a time when you overcame a conflict at work.**

" At my last job, my colleague and I disagreed on how to handle a sensitive situation with our client. We made a mistake in their campaign that resulted in poor overall performance. While my colleague wanted to move forward without explaining the mistake, I thought it would be best to let the client know what happened. After going back and forth, I asked him if we could set some time aside to weigh the costs and benefits of each option. In the end, we needed to see each other’s motivations and fears to get a better understanding of the other.
We decided to let the client know what had happened and agreed to provide them with another campaign at no cost. While it did result in a short-term loss for the company, the client appreciated our honesty and booked an annual campaign exceeding their spending with us in the past. My colleague and I were also recognised for our teamwork and ended up counseling other client teams on conflict resolution. "

### Here are several examples of questions you might be asked in your next behavioural interview. Take some time to prepare sample answers for each both to practice and plan so you will be prepared for future interviews.

### Tell me about yourself

*“I have just over a year of experience as a junior software engineer with First Technology. In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a dozen projects and assisted with managing one project for one of the firm's long-time clients.*

*“Prior to this role, I completed a two-year internship with Mobile First, where I honed my mobile app development skills. Ideally, I would like to continue to specialize in mobile software engineering, an area where I know your firm excels.”*

> Overview + Experience + Why
> 

### **1. Overview Statement – Tell Us Who You Are Professionally**

***Good:*** *“I’m an innovative software engineer with 20 years of experience managing all aspects of the development process for small to medium-sized companies.”*

**This sentence gives a simple summary of a long series of jobs.**

Think of the sentence like this: **"I'm an X X with X years of experience doing X for X X."**

Use the same sentence structure but replace the X's with your words.

The double X's are adjective + noun, like "innovative software engineer" or "medium-sized tech companies."

Adding the word "innovative" puts the focus on your innovation skills. You can change the word or words you use here to target the qualities needed for the job (look at the job description for ideas).

***Bad:*** *“I'm a Support Specialist at Lucent Lighting now. I handle everything after the initial sale – the ordering, troubleshooting, invoicing, etc. Before that I was a voiceover artist and I had my own company.”*

***These jobs are so different that I'm confused as to your identity. What ties them all together?***

When you have different kinds of experience on your resume you need to start with an overview statement that shows who you are.

You overview statement doesn’t have to be complicated. I could say “I’m an interview coach who helps candidates interview for tech jobs” or something like that. It’s much easier if you have a title you can use for yourself, like “interview coach.” Everyone knows what that is so I don’t need to explain it. If you are more than one thing your overview statement won’t be as simple as a few words.

### **2. The Most Relevant Examples of Your Experience**

This section should be about five to ten sentences long.

**Tip**: If you have 20 years of experience you won't be able to talk about every job. Pick two to four of the most relevant examples. If you've only been working for one year, it should be easier to summarize your experience, but choose relevant projects and highlight relevant skills.

***Good:*** *“My last job was at Sephora, where I was in charge of the West Coast marketing team. We designed customer attraction and retention plans beginning from the market research stage. Our 2017 goal was a 2% revenue increase over 2016 and we got 3%.”*

***This answer emphasizes relevant experience and gives proof of performance using numbers (percentages).***

***Bad:*** *“My first job was as an administrative assistant for a realty company in Tampa. I learned a great deal in that role but wanted to move into a more customer oriented job, so I became a sales rep at Home Depot. I also volunteered at our community theatre as a mentor to the young actors.”*

**There is nothing in this answers that shows a clear career path. What is the theme of these jobs? What groups them together? If your career path isn't clear you need to make it clear. Start with an overview statement and then relate the next sentences to the overview.**

### **3. Why Are You Here Applying for Their Job/Why Should They Hire You (What Will They Get?**

- Tell them you want this job
- Tell them why you want it in a way that shows how you can help them
- Include what they will get out of it, not what YOU will get out of it (they don't care about you, they only care what you can do for them)

***Good:*** *“I'd love this position as Senior Project Manager because I know I have the skills to manage complicated projects and I'd like to do that for your company.”*

***Short and positive.***

***Bad:*** *“Because my relationship with my boss isn't very good, I want to find new opportunities.”*

***You don't want to say negative things about your current or past jobs, especially about your managers. Also, this answer doesn't talk about the job you are applying for specifically.***

## On projects

If you have any personal projects or internship experience listed on your resume, make sure you can talk extensively about it. I find that if you can really engage with the interviewer on this part you'll be able to get out of them trying to fill the remainding time with more Leetcode problems. I've seen some people get 3-4 leetcode problems with one interviewer which is just insane to me. I would first talk about the motivation behind why this project was created in the first place. If it's something you worked on at an internship, you should be able to contact some more senior folks on your team who can explain this elagantly if you're having trouble coming up with this part. After explaining the motivation, go into how the application itself works. Try to be as detailed as possbile going through the pipeline of all its functionality along with the tools and technology used. Being able to explain what library you used and why you used it will show the interviewer you actually understand how pieces of the system work together. The last and probably the most important part is explaining your contribution to the project. What did you do? Why was it important for this piece you worked on to exist? What challenges did you face coming up with the solution? Why did you use this library/language in particular? Do you think there was a better way to do this? These are all questions that came up in some form or another so make sure you start thinking about these things as you're preparing.

# Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

# Ending

Thanks for the call. I like what I heard and from this information, I am confident I could fill the role. I am very interested in this job and would be pleased to meet you in person.

# Behavioral Interview

Believe it or not, there IS a RIGHT way and a WRONG way to answering these questions beyond giving a politically correct answer. There is a hidden technical aspect to this portion.

A lot of behavioral interview prep out there is pretty half-baked because the response can vary so widely and there is no consistent course/method of evaluation to finetune a response. A basic non-technical interview practice coach is probably fine if you want to get comfortable talking about your projects. But it can quickly spin into a technical discussion into a project on your resume and I don’t think anyone other than another senior engineer can tell you whether you gave the right or wrong answer.There are a lot of small secrets that will help you out but to be perfectly honest, this section is more relevant to the L4+ candidates. L3 candidates, don’t worry if you don’t understand a lot of what I am talking about in this section.It's hard to fail the behavioral interview and 9/10 times, you will get a “you did fine” on the behavioral. However, the 1/10 times can push you into a higher offer if you are borderline. I was actually told, as feedback for my FB interview, that because of the way I thought of my code, the way I approached problems not just from a technical standpoint but from an organizational standpoint, I was considered for an L5 role even though I was only applying for an L4.

## Describe a Time You…

It really does not matter what question is being asked. It can be to describe a weakness. It can be to describe a time when you did not work well with a teammate. What the question is asking is irrelevant.

**What IS relevant is the philosophy and bigger point about what you value in a project and your job.**

Software engineering is hard. And I mean hard. You are combining a bunch of heuristics and rules that are not systematically ordered to try and create a system that millions of people rely on. We are essentially cobbling together parts using past patterns we’ve encountered and that we think will work based on feeling. In fact, if we built bridges the same way we built software, everyone working on the project would be executed for incompetence.To manage all of this properly, you need to understand what your job entails. You need to understand how multiple different factors affect your code ranging from upper management to design patterns to even the very line you write.Let’s take a hypothetical example. Suppose you are asked to write a new feature. However, doing so requires you to rip the guts out of the old code base to do so. How do you handle this? You could refactor the code base to be more accommodating for both the old and new features which would take a lot of time, time you probably don’t have. You could fight to not do the new feature which would expend the political capital of your group. You could just force it in but then your codebase would be a mess and you might have to spend time later cleaning it up or, worst case, force a rewrite.Knowing all these dimensions and all these tradeoffs is what makes a software engineer good. Your job in the interview is to show you can actually think about these issues and you are competent enough to understand what your role is as an engineer.

**In short, your job as an engineer is to understand protect your code.**What does this mean? It means a lot of different things (including balancing “good enough” vs “perfect” code) and talking about it goes beyond the scope of this guide. But the more you understand and care for the code you’re working on, the more you will understand what it means.At any rate, all questions and stories you have should always lead to this principle or at least a principle regarding your belief in how code should be organized/handled. You did not get along with your coworker for a project? Maybe talk about how you did not see eye to eye for the future of the codebase and you resolved it by making the architecture flexible enough to accomodate for future plans. Your biggest weakness? Getting bored when new features aren’t challenging to implement because it means the code base you protect is clean (humble brag).No matter what answer you give, always always always tie it back to how you are committed to the quality and protection of your code. It doesn’t have to be directly. It can be a bit roundabout (ie. team cohesion). But if you cannot eventually tie it to the quality of your code, you are giving a bad answer!No company is going to value a guy who cannot think about the quality of their code or its future impact. At best, they’re just going to be fixing bugs all day. So always try to eventually pivot to your core values after answering the question.

## “Do You Have Any Questions For Me?”

- What don't you like about working at ...?
- What is the hardest thing you've ever had to do at ...?

Believe it or not, the section at the end of the interview where the interviewer asks you “do you have any questions for me?” is actually important. This is your chance to make the interviewer see you in a different light. However, this is only relevant if you actually passed or are borderline on the technical portion because even if you ask the right questions in this portion but failed your technical, it means nothing.

The questions you ask will show the interviewer what you prioritize in your professional career and therefore, your level. As you are promoted, you assume more responsibilities and you must be able to act in a manner befitting of those responsibilities.

If you’re asking about the culture, work-life balance, the environment, core values, switching teams, etc., chances you are a candidate is prioritizing the comfort of the work environment which means you are probably going to think like a typical salaried employee. This is very common for L3 or L4. That is perfectly ok: maybe that is what you prioritize in life because you have a kid outside of work and work isn’t your #1 priority. You can have that and still be very competent.But most engineers, including your interviewer, don’t pay attention to the company’s “core values” or memorize them or really pay attention to the company perks: they’re focused on trying to fix the damn regression that QA found 2 days ago and they have to fix it in the next 4 hours. However, if you’re asking questions about the code base, product cycle, releases, migrations to new languages, how new features get approved, etc., then it's a different ballgame. Engineers who are looking to play a bigger role and expand their presence and skill have a natural inclination to ask these questions because they understand how each of these elements affects their work. They are more valuable to the company because it is more cost-effective to grow talent than to hire new talent and spend 6 months ramping them up on a code base before they contribute anything meaningful.Prioritization of features over code quality can lead to expensive rewrites down the road which means a delay of future features. Migrations to new languages require teaching employees the new language and also require an investigation/experiment into how the new language can affect compilation times and the compiled code size. Issues like these in turn will affect the end user: nobody will want to download an app that has grown from 10mb to 60mb with no significant new features.To show you are the kind of engineer who seriously thinks of issues like this, an example question would be “How do you split your time between new features and refactoring old code? Do you try to spend a chunk of time every cycle dedicated to code cleanup? Or are these dedicated tasks in particular cycles?”This question shows that you are aware of the dangers of bad code and are thinking about how the company management prioritizes preventing this. It can spin naturally into a conversation about the culture of the company and its attitude towards its own products and code base. It can lead to a discussion about how project proposals are done: are they grown from the developers or do they come from the top down?

These are concerns you really only have once you have suffered through multiple scenarios and different prioritizations where those concerns were ignored. So the best way to do this is to really acquire meaningful experience where more senior engineers can tell you how and why different issues occur. However, there are books where you can actually get to this point a lot faster. If you can touch on the topics in the last 5 minutes, you will appear to be far more experienced than your resume may let on.

It is very easy to come up with these questions if you have the experience and understanding of how products and projects can fail because of management/code. The trick is knowing that you need to ask them and what questions you ask can push you into a higher offer.
