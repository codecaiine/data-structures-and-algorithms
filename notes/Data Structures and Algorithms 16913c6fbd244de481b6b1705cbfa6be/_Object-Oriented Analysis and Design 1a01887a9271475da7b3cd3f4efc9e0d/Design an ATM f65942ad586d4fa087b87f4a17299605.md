An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic telecommunications instrument that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier or bank teller. ATMs are necessary as not all the bank branches are open every day of the week, and some customers may not be in a position to visit a bank each time they want to withdraw or deposit money.
