Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

Binary search:
    - if the element at mid is in an increasing order:
        - if we move to the right, we might find a peak(decreases) or the array end 
            which are both valid answers
    - the opposite is also True
